description: Published in 1879, the stories collected in Old Friends and New are written
  with Jewett's keen insight and gentle humor, and offer a vivid display of her genius
  as a writer. Her poignant depictions of elderly women as seen through the eyes of
  the young, is a theme that runs prominently through the collection. Included are
  A Late Supper," A Sorrowful Guest," and A Bit of Shore Life."
